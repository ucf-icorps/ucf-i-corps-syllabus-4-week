## Allowable Expenses

I-Corps funds are to be used for Customer Discovery and MVP development.

* Customer Discovery: Expenses related to finding, setting, and conducting interviews/meetings with individuals or groups who the PI, El, Mentor and team thinks will benefit from the product, or who can give insights as to what a customer for this product would want or find valuable. This includes admission to events such as trade shows and conferences; travel expenses incurred in traveling to the interview/meeting/event; and any other expense that comes about as a direct result of engaging in these customer interviews.
    * Per Diem is allowable up to $30 per day per individual, only if outside of a 50 mile radius of UCF, and only if staying overnight at a location
       * Per Diem is not allowable if attending an event which includes meals in the entry fee
       * Per Diem must be spent on team members only. It may not be used to purchase the meal of the interviewee or any other outside individual (i.e. no wining and dining)

* MVP development: Any expense incurred in developing an MVP. MVP stands for “minimum viable product”. The MVP is used during interviews to show the customer specific features of the product, or to give a deeper level of understanding of the product than words alone, in order to gain better feedback on what’s good/bad/valuable about the product. The MVP can be a fully functional product, a prototype, a model, a diagram, a wire frame, a poster board, a card-board cutout, or anything else that demonstrates how the product will be used, what it may look like and/or what features it will have. The money may be used to develop this MVP, procure supplies and materials necessary for development, and/or for paying contractors (outside of the team) to build specific features or aspects of the MVP.
    * No member of the team may pay themselves stipends, labor costs, etc.
    
**I-Corps funds may not be used for any administrative, legal, or entertainment expenses.**
