* Slide 3: What were your objective pass/fail metrics for each "Get" test/methodology:

    * What is your customer acquisition cost?

    * What is your customer lifetime value?

    * Build demand creation budget and forecast.

* Slide 4: What did you learn about your Customer Relationship (Get/Keep/Grow)?

    * Hypothesis: Here’s What we Thought

    * Experiments: Here’s What we Did

    * Results:  Here’s What we Found

    * Action: 	Here’s What we Are Going to Do Next

### MVP

* For Web/Mobile teams

    * Get a working Web site and analytics up and running.

        * Track where your visitors are coming from (marketing campaign, search engine, etc.) and how their behavior differs.

    * What were your hypotheses about your Web site results? Engage in "search engine marketing" (SEM); spend $20 to test customer acquisition

        * Ask your users to take action, (email, signing up).

    * Use analytics (Google/Kissmetrics, etc.) to measure the success of your campaign.

    * Change messaging on site during the week to get costs lower.

    * If you’re assuming virality of your product, you will need to show viral propagation of your product and the improvement of your viral coefficient.

* Physical products show any iterations or improvements in demo prototype, model and/or Kickstarter campaign.
