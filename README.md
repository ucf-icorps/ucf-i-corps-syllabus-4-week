The Lean LaunchPad - Evidence Based Entrepreneurship

This class is taught as part of the NSF Funded Effort: "UCF I-Corps Site: enhancing technology commercialization to develop a world-class innovation ecosystem"

Innovation Corps (I-Corps) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded grant that aims to teach researchers how to commercialize their research and ideas through the Business Model Canvas. While the NSF provides the teams that go through I-Corps with seed funding, UCF coordinates all of the sessions, provides nationally certified instructors, matches teams with seasoned business mentors, and countless follow-on service with collaboration of the UCF and Orlando entrepreneurship community. The UCF I-Corps program is a part of the start-up community in Central Florida that aims to support and further develop an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship where local companies can start, grow, and thrive.
